Whisper Labs + ChatGPT voiceover with OCR for games like [This Baldur's Gate 3 outtake](https://youtu.be/bOrfytcX8mM?si=Z8GBHDHv-Qobd8Va)

This tool uses OCR to read text on the screen, then queries it through OpenAI's ChatGPT API to check its meaningfulness. If yes, it generates dialogue via GPT and plays it as voiceover, using Eleven Labs with a specified voice.

Notes: 
  - Requires a paid [Eleven Labs subscription](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis). Basic plan is 5 USD/month.
  - You'll also need an [OpenAI account](https://tinyurl.com/euxs2xvw) with billing set up, pay-per-use.
