Create a pyhon app that in realtime (or quasi-realtime) monitors the trext on the screen (OCR) and performs AI commentary on it using OpenAI GPT prompts. Use a vector database to keep track of all read text over time, so that it can have memory - via indexing into a vector index (e.g. using llama index). When it sees new text on screen, it can suggest a next action (via printing to console) about that text - in the context of what it has seen in the past. E.g. it can suggest a dialogue option to a player of a video game based on previous dialogue in a conversation.
