The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `ScreenReader`: This class will use the pytesseract library to perform OCR on the screen in real-time.
2. `DialogueHistory`: This class will manage the history of dialogues, storing up to 500 characters of past dialogue.
3. `AICommentator`: This class will use the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate commentary based on the current dialogue and dialogue history.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application, orchestrating the other components.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
